# Udacity-CppNanodegree

Projects associated with Udacity's C++ nanodegree.

This repository contains each of the five projects completed as part of Udacity's C++ nanodegree. For each project, Udacity provided the foundational code, while I added the necessary additional functionalities, which are further detailed in the README of each project.

**Route Planning:** Implementation of the A* search algorithm to find a path between two nodes on a map.

**System Monitor:** Development of a simpler version of [htop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Htop), a system-monitor, process-viewer and process-manager for Linux.

**Memory Management Bot:** Creation of a simple chatbot application to practice memory management techniques such as smart pointers, and dynamic memory allocation.

**Concurrent Traffic Simulation:** A multi-threaded traffic simulator that models intersections, vehicles, and traffic lights.

**Capstone Project (work in progress):**
